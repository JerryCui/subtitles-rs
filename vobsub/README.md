### Fuzz testing

We test some portions of this crate using the
excellent [`cargo fuzz`][fuzz] tool.  To run these tests, install `cargo
fuzz` according to its documentation.  Then run:

```sh
env RUST_BACKTRACE=1 rustup run nightly cargo fuzz run fuzzer_script_1 -- \
    -dict=dictionary.txt -detect_leaks=0
```

You can also pass `-jobs N` to run multiple jobs in parallel.  By default,
this is limited to half the number of available CPU cores.

If it finds a crash, then copy the test case it produces back into our
standard test suite and run the tests:

```sh
cp fuzz/artifacts/* ../fixtures/invalid
cargo test
```

This will allow us to tell whether the bug is fixed, and to detect any
regressions.  Once the bug is fixed, call `cargo fuzz run` again (as shown
above).
